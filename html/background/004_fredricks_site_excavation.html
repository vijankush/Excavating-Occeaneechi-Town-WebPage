          <h1>Fredricks Site Excavation</h1>
                                  <p>Because the Fredricks site was discovered late in the 1983 field season, investigations that summer were relatively brief. A limited excavation of 800 sq ft revealed a portion of a cemetery lying just outside the village (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 10&lt;/b&gt;. Sq. 280R90 at top of subsoil (view to north)." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x6171.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>photo</u></a>) and a segment of the village palisade (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 11&lt;/b&gt;. Sq. 270R90 at top of subsoil (view to north)." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x6158.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>photo</u></a>). Three human burials within the cemetery were excavated. All three pits were rectangular with sharp corners (indicating that they probably were excavated with metal tools) and contained numerous artifacts of Euroamerican manufacture. A fourth pit excavated within the cemetery contained neither human remains nor grave associations (see photos of <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 13&lt;/b&gt;.

                                                          <p>A second field season at the Fredricks site, conducted during the summer of 1984 and sponsored by the National Geographic Society, uncovered a much larger area of the cemetery and the adjacent village (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Dickens, Roy S., Jr., H.

These investigations were designed to obtain additional data on mortuary behavior and to begin sampling domestic areas. In addition, systematic subsurface testing was undertaken on unexcavated portions of the site to delimit probable site boundaries and to make a preliminary assessment of internal site structure.</p>
                                                          <p>During 1984, 27 new 10-ft by 10-ft units (2,700 ft<sup>2</sup>) were excavated, and six of the eight units excavated in 1983 were re-exposed (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 17&lt;/b&gt;. Excavating plowed soil at the Fredricks site in 1984." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x6648.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>general view of excavation</u></a>). These excavations uncovered six additional burials within the cemetery, a 90-ft palisade segment, and approximately 2,250 ft<sup>2</sup> of the village area inside the palisade (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 18&lt;/b&gt;.

Mapping and excavating burials." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x6752.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>burial excavation</u></a>). Mapping of postholes revealed two complete domestic structures. In addition, an oval, wall-trench sweat lodge with an interior fire pit was exposed in the southwesternmost corner of the excavation (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 20&lt;/b&gt;. Outlining Structure 1 and Feature 9 prior to mapping." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x6804.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>sweat lodge</u></a>). Subsurface testing of unexcavated areas consisted of auger sampling at 2.5-ft intervals to identify archaeological features. This procedure proved to be highly reliable and was successful both in delimiting the remainder of the cemetery and in identifying areas of intensive domestic activity within the village. It was somewhat less effective, however, in providing a precise definition of site boundaries (see <a class="a-ref" data-author="Davis, R. P. Stephen, Jr., and H. Trawick Ward" data-ref-text="1987  A Comparison of Plowzone and In Situ Site Structure at the Fredricks Site, A Siouan Village in Piedmont North Carolina.

                                                          <p>In 1985, a third season of fieldwork was made possible by additional funding from the National Geographic Society (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Dickens, Roy S., Jr., H. Trawick Ward, and R. P. Stephen Davis, Jr." data-ref-text="1985b  &lt;i&gt;The Historic Occaneechi: An Archaeological Investigation of Culture Change.

Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Dickens et al. [ed.] 1986</u></a>). These excavations exposed 62 10-ft by 10-ft units, more than doubling the total area uncovered during the previous two field seasons (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 22&lt;/b&gt;. View of excavations at the Fredricks site in 1985." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x7507.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>general view of excavation</u></a>). The large excavated area made it possible to estimate the overall size of the village as well as to predict its internal spatial configuration. Twenty-five features and three burials were excavated (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 23&lt;/b&gt;. Excavating and cleaning archaeological features in 1985." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x7445.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>feature excavation</u></a>). The burials were the last remaining in the cemetery, bringing the total to 12 with an additional probable burial. Six new structures also were defined as a result of the 1985 work, and approximately 100 ft of the palisade were exposed as it continued to encircle the habitation area (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 24&lt;/b&gt;. Cleaning Structure 6 (foreground) and Structure 5 (background) prior to mapping." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x7563.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>cleaning house patterns</u></a>). At the end of the 1985 field season, it was estimated that the village compound within the palisade was small, comprising only about .25 acres. A total of 11-12 houses were estimated to have sheltered approximately 50-75 individuals (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 25&lt;/b&gt;. The 1985 archaeological field crew at the Fredricks site." data-figure-path="../../imgs/x16/x7548.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>1985 crew</u></a>).</p>
                                                          <p>The 1986 excavation at the Fredricks site uncovered all the remaining village area enclosed within the palisade except for a small section in the southwest corner where large trees prevented soil removal (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 26&lt;/b&gt;.

Although still small, the village shape was more irregular than predicted after the 1985 field season. The irregular outline resulted from the fact that the palisade "bowed-out" or expanded to the southwest, thus creating a D-shaped rather than oval configuration. Although much of the structural evidence continued to consist of vague posthole clusters, two additional wall-trench structures were defined and the 13 pit features associated with the structures were extremely rich. Their depositional character and contents added significant new data that aided in clarifying general as well as specific behavioral patterns within the village. In addition, two human burials, two possible burial pits, a possible hearth, and an irregular trench were excavated. Another probable pit (<a href="..\excavations\083_feature_60_burial_27.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 60</u></a>) and a shallow basin (<a href="..\excavations\075_feature_52.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 52</u></a>) were mapped but not excavated (see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 27&lt;/b&gt;.

                                              <p>Archaeological field methods were consistent throughout all field seasons at the Fredricks site. Each season, preliminary site preparation consisted of bushhogging the work area and re-establishing the site grid and reference point for elevations.

A 20-liter soil sample from the plowzone of each unit was waterscreened through 1/16-inch mesh to assess small artifact content.</p>
                                                          <p>Following the removal of plowzone, the bottom of each excavation unit (top of subsoil) was carefully <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 30&lt;/b&gt;.
