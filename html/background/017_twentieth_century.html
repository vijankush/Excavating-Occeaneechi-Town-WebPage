          <h1>Twentieth Century</h1>
                                  <p>Most of the residents of the Texas community were members of these related families up until just a few decades ago, when other people began moving in in greater numbers, buying land from the original families, who were now depending less on agriculture as a way of life. Around the turn of the twentieth century, two churches were formed to minister to the spiritual needs of the community, where formerly circuit riding preachers had provided religious guidance. Jeffries Cross Church and Martin's Chapel Baptist Church were both churches built on land given by members of the community (Joe and Levi Jeffries and Sam Martin [see <a class="a-img" data-figure-caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 47&lt;/b&gt;. David Martin (son of Sam Martin) and wife Adeline Jeffries (c. 1890)." data-figure-path="../../imgs/h16/hazel12.jpeg" data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="body"><u>descendant</u></a>], respectively). The churches are still strong, although they no longer are attended solely by members of the Texas community.</p>
                                                          <p>Several small schools served the children of the area, and these were attended primarily by Indian people. The Martin School, Patillo School, and Crawford School all had large numbers of Indian students, with Martin School being almost exclusively Indian; however, this did not prevent the Alamance County Board of Education from classifying them as "Colored." In 1930, the Martin School was consolidated with several other small schools to form Pleasant Grove Union School, a move that was not popular in the community since it meant that the school no longer was exclusively Indian. It did mean an improvement in the educational facilities available to the children, and so it was eventually accepted by the parents. Today, Pleasant Grove School, still in use as an elementary school, is a source of pride to the community members, many of whom still take an active interest in its affairs.</p>
                                                          <p>In 1934, an effort was made by some of the members of the community to have the federal government provide a school for the Indian children of the area. Clayton Jeffries, Charles Will Jeffries, and others retained an attorney, contacted another local Indian group (in Person County, which had an Indian school sponsored by the state), formed a list of Indian families, and began correspondence with Commissioner John Collier of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. This information exists in the National Archives (<a class="a-ref" data-author="U.S. Commission of Indian Affairs" data-ref-text="1934-1935  Commission of Indian Affairs Papers.  National Archives Record Group 75-3218-34-800, Washington, D.C." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>U.S. Commission of Indian Affairs 1934-1935</u></a>) and provides some insight into the social situation of the day in the community. An agent from the bureau visited Clayton Jeffries and his family, and reported back, in part "that he says his wife nor he have no [sic] colored blood," and further, "I do think we ought to know about these people. It is almost certain that Clayton and most of the 'Texas' people have some Indian blood." There are also several letters from Clayton Jeffries, which contain some interesting information. He stated that there were 90 families of their people in the area and that they came from Virginia around the time of the Revolutionary War. This would mean an increase from 1830, when 66 families in the area can be identified as Indian or part Indian. The commissioner and his assistants, despite a letter from Alamance County School Superintendent M. E. Younts that scornfully refers to all members of the Texas community as "Negroes," refers to the community as Indian. However, the bureau finally ended the correspondence to Clayton Jeffries by saying, "We will keep your particular Indian group in mind and should it be possible for us to do anything for you, your case will receive careful consideration." No assistance was ever received from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the only benefit being their recognition of the community as an Indian community.</p>
