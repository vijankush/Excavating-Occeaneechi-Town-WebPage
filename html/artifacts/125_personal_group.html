          <h1>Personal Group</h1>
            <p>This artifact group, which contained the greatest number and variety of European trade items, was divided into three classes: (1) ornaments; (2) grooming implements; and (3) entertainment items. The ornament class was the largest and consisted of jewelry items such as glass beads, brass bells, and wire bracelets. A few of the artifacts from the personal group were datable.</p>
            <p><i>Ornaments</i></p>
            <p>A total of 12,488 <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/x16/x7681.jpeg" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 349&lt;/b&gt;. Glass trade beads." href="../../imgs/x16/x7681.jpeg"><u>glass beads</u></a> were found at the Fredricks site. Three ivory beads also were recovered. Wampum beads and other aboriginally manufactured shell beads are discussed with shell ornaments.</p>
            <p>The three ivory beads were recovered from <a href="..\excavations\022_burial_2.html"><u>Burial 2</u></a>, <a href="..\excavations\023_burial_3.html"><u>Burial 3</u></a>, and <a href="..\excavations\036_feature_13.html"><u>Feature 13</u></a>. All are 6 mm in diameter, 5 mm long, spherical, have polished exteriors, and were yellowed with age. Beads of this type, often called "rosary beads," have been found at Fort Michilimackinac (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Stone, Lyle" data-ref-text="1974  &lt;i&gt;Fort Michilimackinac 1715&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;1781&lt;/i&gt;.

Color preference varied with bead size.  Glass beads were present in most excavated contexts at the Fredricks site; however, none were recovered from <a href="..\excavations\031_feature_8.html"><u>Feature 8</u></a> or <a href="..\excavations\053_feature_30.html"><u>Feature 30</u></a>, both of which are prehistoric features that predate the Occaneechi occupation.</p>

A majority of these beads were white (89.3%), though numerous redwood (8.9%) and blue seed beads (1.4%) also were recovered. Kent (1984:211-223) has placed the peak popularity for blue seed beads at 1575 to 1760, with a major increase from 1600 to 1665. The popularity of white beads seems to have remained fairly consistent throughout the Historic period. For the most part, however, the trade records lack details of glass beads.</p>
            <p>Glass beads greater than 4 mm in diameter likely were worn on strands and only secondarily as sewn decorations on garments. In contrast to the small seed beads, the larger beads were predominantly redwood in color and of a type commonly referred to as <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/d_1272.jpeg" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 351&lt;/b&gt;.

            <p>Finally, Kent (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Kent, Barry C." data-ref-text="1984  &lt;i&gt;Susquehanna's Indians&lt;/i&gt;.  The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, Anthropological Series, No.  6. Harrisburg." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal"><u>1984</u></a>:213) offers a few critical observations on the use of bead types as chronological indicators. At Susquehannock sites, straw beads (tubular or cane beads) had their greatest popularity between 1630 and 1670; sites dating after 1670 contained fewer straw beads and more tumbled seed beads. Also, numbers of wire-wound beads (all sizes) increased on sites dating to the middle-to-late eighteenth century. Polhemus's (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Polhemus, Richard (editor)" data-ref-text="1987  &lt;i&gt;The Toqua Site: A Late Mississippian Dallas Phase Town&lt;/i&gt;.  Report of Investigations 41.  Department of Anthropology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal"><u>1987</u></a>:939-946) observations at Overhill Cherokee town sites confirm these temporal trends in bead popularity. The only wire-wound beads found at the Fredricks site were the "Roman" beads. Based on the above information, a date between 1670 and 1740 for the historic occupation of the Fredricks site is reasonable.</p>
            <p>Bells appear frequently on trade inventories and apparently were popular ornamental items among the Indians. Thirty-five sheet brass bells were recovered from the Fredricks site, and all but two were recovered from features or burials. Twenty-three <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/d_1700.jpeg" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 104&lt;/b&gt;.

These bells appear to have been sewn together on straps or on a garment and fastened around the knees of the individual, 12 around one knee and 11 around the other. The bells from Burial 7 are identified as a flush-edge type, made of stamped sheet brass by flush-loop construction, and they measure 15.5 mm in diameter. A small iron sphere was visible through the holes of the lower hemisphere of each bell.

            <p>Stem fragments of kaolin pipes from the Fredricks site were sorted by context and by bore diameter. A general period of manufacture was calculated for each bore diameter using the formula of Harrington (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Harrington, Jean C." data-ref-text="1954  Dating Stem Fragments of 17th and 18th Century Clay Tobacco Pipes. &lt;i&gt;Quarterly Bulletin of the Archeological Society of Virginia&lt;/i&gt; 9(1):10-14." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal"><u>1954</u></a>:6-8). Of 42 measurable mid-section fragments recovered during 1983 and 1984, 55% belong to a 1650-1680 period of manufacture, whereas 33% date to 1680-1710. When Binford's (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Binford, Lewis R." data-ref-text="1962  A New Method of Calculating Dates from Kaolin Pipe Stem Samples. &lt;i&gt;Southeastern Archaeological Conference Newsletter&lt;/i&gt; 9:19-21." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal"><u>1962</u></a>:19-21) regression formula was applied to the sample, a date of 1678.95 was determined for plowzone pipe stems, and a date of 1683.16 was calculated for pipe stems from burial/feature contexts. This finding strongly suggests that the pipe stems recovered in the plowzone can be identified with the same occupation that is responsible for the burials and features. Because of the small sample (18 stems from plowzone and 24 from burial/feature contexts), and criticisms of the validity of pipe-stem dating, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of these dates.</p>
            <p>Aboriginally manufactured clay pipes from the Fredricks site were analyzed for form, decoration, composition, completeness, and dimensions of stem length, bore diameter, and bowl-to-stem angle. Decorations on a few of the bowls and stem sections included incised bands, roulettes, punctations, and dentate designs. Paste consisted of micaceous clays, sometimes with fine-grain grit tempering. Although none was glazed, many exhibited evidence of burning through soot deposits. A few specimens revealed marks of metal tools. An attempt was made to correlate bore diameters of the finer-made, or tooled, aboriginal pipes to the bore diameters of European kaolin pipes. Using the same gauges as were used on the aboriginal specimens, an average bore diameter of 8/64 in (3.7 mm) was obtained from 26 specimens.
