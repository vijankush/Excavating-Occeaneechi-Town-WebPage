          <h1>Ground-Stone Tools</h1>
            <p>Several types of ground-stone tools are also present in the assemblage, including ground-stone disks similar in size and shape to the chipped disks found at the site. Several other broken, unidentified, ground-stone specimens are also present. Identifiable raw materials from which these artifacts were made include fine-grained granite, schist, igneous, felsic tuff, and some type of metavolcanic rock. Four broken, polished cobbles are present from feature contexts. Two <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_3462.BMP" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 229&lt;/b&gt;. Chunkey stones from Feature 17 (RLA catalog no. 2351a6196)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_3462.BMP"><u>chunkey stones</u></a>--one complete and one broken--were also recovered from feature contexts. A complete specimen, of fine-grained granite, is well made and very smooth. It is approximately 65 mm in diameter and plano-convex in cross section. The other specimen is a highly polished quartz cobble. Although broken, it appears to have been slightly larger than the complete specimen and also plano-convex in cross section.</p>
            <p>The six ground-stone disks found in 1986 range from 30-50 mm in diameter, are relatively thin, and are flat in cross section. One specimen, however, is much thicker and more plano-convex in cross section, and somewhat resembles a small chunkey stone. Still another <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_3447.BMP" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 236&lt;/b&gt;. Stone disk fragment from Feature 47 (RLA catalog no. 2378a344)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_3447.BMP"><u>specimen</u></a> is half-moon shaped. It is uncertain whether this item was originally manufactured into this shape or represents a broken disk that was reworked into this form. Only two of these ground-stone disks could be identified as to raw material; both were made from schist. The function(s) of these artifacts remain unknown. Several other ground-stone fragments of unidentifiable types also are present in the artifact sample.</p>
            <p>A single <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_2020.JPG" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 95&lt;/b&gt;. Celt from Burial 10 (RLA catalog no. 2351a6758)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_2020.JPG"><u>ground-stone celt</u></a>, 95 mm in length, was recovered from <a href="..\excavations\050_feature_27_burial_10.html"><u>Burial 10</u></a>. Made of fine-grained granite, the celt has a bi-convex working edge that tapers slightly to a rounded distal end and which gives it a wedge-shaped appearance. This tool was probably used for chopping. Two other celt fragments (<a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_3454.BMP" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 237&lt;/b&gt;. Ground-stone celt fragment from Sq. 210R50 (RLA catalog no. 2378a1800)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_3454.BMP"><u>first</u></a>, <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_3455.BMP" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 238&lt;/b&gt;. Ground-stone celt fragment from Sq. 230R110 (RLA catalog no. 2378a2463)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_3455.BMP"><u>second</u></a>) were recovered from the plowzone.</p>
            <p><a href="..\excavations\032_feature_9.html"><u>Feature 9</u></a> contained a number of large rocks that were fire-cracked or have burned exterior surfaces. Two large fragments that were separated in the bottom of Feature 9 were refitted. When the two fragments were joined, worn and smoothed surfaces could be traced on both the upper and lower surfaces. The smoothing on one surface appears to be the result of use as a grinding stone, whereas the polish on the other surface may have been formed by the movement of the stone against the ground or other surface during its use as a grinding stone.</p>
            <p><a href="..\excavations\041_feature_18.html"><u>Feature 18</u></a> was a circular, shallow pit that contained a heavy concentration of simple-stamped and check-stamped sherds. In addition, it contained a number of stone fragments from a partially reconstructible grinding stone. One of the surfaces of this tool appeared to have been flattened and smoothed from use.</p>
            <p>Single examples of a mano, nutting stone, and anvil were recovered in 1986. The mano, made of igneous rock, is roughly rectangular (80 x 67 mm) in shape, relatively thick (37 mm), and triangular to trapezoidal in cross section. The top and bottom faces of this tool were smoothed by abrasion and grinding. The nutting stone is a large (210 x 112 mm) flat piece of schist with several circular depressions, similar in nature to the pitted cobble depressions described above, on both sides. One surface contains approximately 11 irregularly spaced depressions ranging from 10-25 mm in diameter. The reverse side exhibits about 10 irregularly spaced depressions ranging between 10 and 20 mm in diameter. The traditional interpretation of artifacts such as nutting stones and pitted cobbles is that they are a product of nut processing. A portion of a broken corner of an anvil also was recovered. It is made of metavolcanic rock, has ground edges, is crushed and pitted on one surface.</p>
            <p>Finally, a single fragment of a ground-stone pipe bowl was recovered from feature context. It also refits with a ground-stone pipe stem recovered from the plowzone of an adjacent square. The <a class="a-img" data-src="../../imgs/d16/D_3431.BMP" data-sub-html="&lt;b&gt;Figure 239&lt;/b&gt;. Refitted stone pipe fragments from Feature 48 and Sq. 270R20 plowzone (RLA catalog nos. 2378a380,2351a4537)." href="../../imgs/d16/D_3431.BMP"><u>pipe</u></a> is unfinished and appears to have been broken during manufacture. The break occurred at a point where the bowl joins the stem. The pipe bowl had not been completely hollowed out nor had an air hole been drilled through the stem. The stem is tubular in shape, approximately 50 mm in length, and 16 mm in diameter. The bowl is circular in plan view and what appears to be a slight lip is present near the top of the bowl.</p>
