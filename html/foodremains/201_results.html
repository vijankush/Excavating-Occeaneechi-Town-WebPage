                                                          <p>In general, analysis of plant remains from the 1986 season at Fredricks confirmed earlier interpretations of plant use at the site. The following discussion will, for the most part, depend upon the cumulative findings of four field seasons. This comprehensive data set is more useful as a basis for interpretation of plant use since its division into sets by date of excavation is an artificial one imposed by researchers and has no direct relevance to the activities of site occupants. However, several types of plant remains not recovered in previous years deserve special mention.</p>

Like peach, watermelon was introduced to North America by Europeans. It was apparently first grown in North America by Spanish colonists in the coastal Southeast as early as the late sixteenth century. Watermelon seems to have reached the Atlantic Coast colonies somewhat later by way of the West Indies (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Blake, Leonard W." data-ref-text="1981  Early Acceptance of Watermelon by Indians of the United States. &lt;i&gt;Ethnobiology&lt;/i&gt; 1:193-199." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Blake 1981</u></a>:194). Unlike peach, which originated in Asia, watermelon is thought to be native to Africa. Its adoption by post-contact Native American groups of the Eastern Woodlands was no doubt facilitated by the aboriginal practice of cultivation of New World cucurbits. The only other occurrence of watermelon from North Carolina is from Upper Saratown (31Sk1a), a site roughly contemporaneous with Fredricks on the Dan River in Stokes County, from which a single seed was reported (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Wilson, Jack H., Jr." data-ref-text="1977  &lt;i&gt;Feature Fill, Plant Utilization and Disposal Among the Historic Sara Indians&lt;/i&gt;.  Unpublished M.A. thesis, Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Wilson 1977</u></a>). It is difficult to assess the extent of use of watermelon at Fredricks. Because of its thin rind and the fact that the fruit would not have been dried for storage or cooked for consumption, watermelon remains are likely to be underrepresented archaeologically relative to the frequency of its use.</p>
                                                          <p>Other plant taxa not recovered during previous seasons at Fredricks are strawberry (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i> Duchesne) and amaranth (<i>Amaranthus</i> sp.). Strawberry seeds are minute and have not been recovered frequently from Eastern archaeological sites. Strawberry plants probably grew near the village in old fields and woods edges, which are the species's preferred habitat today (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Radford, Albert E., Harry F. Ahles, and C. Ritchie Bell" data-ref-text="1968  &lt;i&gt;A Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas&lt;/i&gt;.

The food value of this species is somewhat limited by the size of the fruits, but strawberry could have been a useful diet supplement or "snack food" in the spring and early summer, when most other fruit-producing species are still maturing.</p>
                                                          <p>Species of amaranth are common weeds in fields and disturbed ground. Although cultivated varieties were developed in Mesoamerica and are still used there today, amaranth is seldom reported from North American sites. The presence of a single seed in <a href="..\excavations\074_feature_51.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 51</u></a> at Fredricks is best explained by the plants having grown near the site and their seeds having been carried into a fire by wind or, unintentionally, by people. Although amaranth could have been used as spring greens, the seeds would have been present in the fall.</p>

The values are, however, quite close and probably also reflect acorn shell's lower preservability. A ranking of nutshell occurrences by ubiquity results in the same relative order as ranking by weight (hickory first, acorn second, and walnut third). Considering acorn's high meat-to-shell ratio and lower shell preservability relative to hickory, the interpretation that acorn was perhaps a larger dietary component than hickory nuts at Fredricks and probably of approximately equal importance is a reasonable one. Walnut was only a minor food.</p>
                                                          <p>The relative subsistence importance of these three nut types is relatively easy to determine because we have some knowledge of the meat-to-shell ratios of two of the genera and also an understanding of preservation factors that might influence representation of nutshell types. Trying to compare nuts to cultigens or different types of cultigens to each other, on the other hand, is subject to considerable difficulties. Hickory nutshell is dense and durable and likely to be preserved through carbonization, unlike more fragile remains such as <i>Cucurbita</i> rind. Maize cupules and rachis fragments are fairly dense, whereas the kernels are starchy and less durable. Common bean is more likely to be prepared by boiling than by parching or roasting, so the seeds are less likely to become carbonized. The three Mesoamerican cultigens found at the Fredricks site (maize, <i>Zea mays</i> L.; pepo squash, <i>Cucurbita pepo</i> L.; and common bean, <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) therefore produce archaeological remains that can be difficult to interpret.</p>
                                                          <p>However, of the three Mesoamerican cultigens, maize was certainly the most important. Although the percentage of maize remains is quite low compared to most other types of plant foods from the 1986 season at 4.7% (<a class="a-table" data-table-header="&lt;b&gt;Table 40&lt;/b&gt;.

                                                          <p>The importance of maize to the Fredricks site population as a staple is confirmed using several methods of comparison and quantification. What quantities of common bean and pepo squash were used by this group is impossible to tell. Lawson (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Lefler, Hugh T. (editor)" data-ref-text="1967  &lt;i&gt;A New Voyage to Carolina by John Lawson&lt;/i&gt;.  University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Lefler 1967</u></a>:82-83, 182) refers to several types of legumes and squashes grown by Indians in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont, so presumably both were of some dietary importance during the Historic period. Preservation and depositional factors have probably resulted in the underrepresentation of these cultigens relative to their actual importance. Although maize was more important than common bean or pepo squash (probably used in quantities similar to acorn and hickory nuts), the magnitude of difference in importance is impossible to assess.</p>
                                                          <p>Only two Old World domesticates, watermelon and peach (<i>Prunus persica</i> L.), were found at Fredricks. Watermelon is discussed above along with other taxa first discovered in the 1986 sample. Like peach, watermelon is somewhat weedy, being capable of colonizing highly disturbed habitats. Watermelon occurs today as a waif in waste places (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Radford, Albert E., Harry F. Ahles, and C. Ritchie Bell" data-ref-text="1968  &lt;i&gt;A Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas&lt;/i&gt;. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Radford et al. 1968</u></a>:999); although it can germinate successfully without human aid, it requires some husbandry in order to maintain a population. Watermelon has growing requirements similar to those for other cucurbits, and was probably easily incorporated into the aboriginal gardening system. Peach is frequently found today as an escape from cultivation (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Radford, Albert E., Harry F. Ahles, and C. Ritchie Bell" data-ref-text="1968  &lt;i&gt;A Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas&lt;/i&gt;. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Radford et al. 1968</u></a>:566). Native to Asia, the peach was first imported into the New World by the Spanish as a mission crop in the sixteenth century (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Sheldon, Elisabeth Shepard" data-ref-text="1978  Childersburg: Evidence of European Contact Demonstrated by Archaeological Plant Remains.  &lt;i&gt;Southeastern Archaeological Conference Special Publication No. 5&lt;/i&gt;, pp. 28-29." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Sheldon 1978</u></a>). The English brought peach pits to the Massachussetts Bay Colony as early as 1669 (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Hedrick, U. P.

Dover Publications, New York." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Hedrick 1972</u></a>:463). In part because of its weedy properties, peach may have been dispersed somewhat independently of direct aboriginal/European contact. A number of European observers (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Salley, Alexander S. (editor)" data-ref-text="1911  &lt;i&gt;Narratives of Early Carolina, 1650&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;1708&lt;/i&gt;.

However, they may not have recognized signs of limited husbandry.</p>
                                                          <p>Although peach trees can grow and produce fruit without human intervention, they were probably tended to some extent at the Fredricks site, at least through removal of plants competing for light and nutrients and perhaps through planting as well. Fredricks site inhabitants may have tended, planted, or otherwise protected native fruit trees such as persimmon before contact, although there is no direct evidence for such practices. Peach trees produce fruit in three to five years after germination (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Sheldon, Elisabeth Shepard" data-ref-text="1978  Childersburg: Evidence of European Contact Demonstrated by Archaeological Plant Remains.  &lt;i&gt;Southeastern Archaeological Conference Special Publication No. 5&lt;/i&gt;, pp. 28-29." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Sheldon 1978</u></a>) and relatively little investment of time or energy would have yielded large amounts of palatable fruit (reported by Lawson to have been dried and made into cakes for later consumption [<a class="a-ref" data-author="Lefler, Hugh T.

Although it was probably an important fruit crop, peach was a dietary supplement and not a staple. Considering the weight and durability of the pit, greater representation would be expected if peach were as important as a food such as hickory nut.

High preservability probably increases the contrast in representation between peach and other fleshy fruits.</p>
                                                          <p>The indigenous fleshy fruits recovered from the Fredricks site are mostly heliophilic species or genera that favor disturbed ground or edges between wooded and open areas. All of them generally produce greater quantities of fruit in these kinds of habitats than in closed-canopy situations. Taxa found at Fredricks such as bramble (<i>Rubus</i> sp.), sumac (<i>Rhus</i> sp.), strawberry, elderberry (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i> L.), hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> sp.), persimmon (<i>Diospyros virginiana</i> L.), blueberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> sp.), viburnum (<i>Viburnum</i> sp.), and grape (<i>Vitis</i> sp.) all indicate some degree of forest opening (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Yarnell, Richard A." data-ref-text="1982  Problems of Interpretation of Archaeological Plant Remains of the Eastern Woodlands.  &lt;i&gt;Southeastern Archaeology&lt;/i&gt; 1:1-7." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Yarnell 1982</u></a>:5) because of their preference for gaps in the forest canopy. Thus there is strong evidence for a symbiotic relationship between humans and these taxa, probably something on the order of Rindos's (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Rindos, David" data-ref-text="1984  &lt;i&gt;The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective&lt;/i&gt;. Academic Press, New York." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>1984</u></a>) incidental or specialized domestication, in which humans increase habitat areas for useful plants and disperse their seeds incidentally to consumption of the fruits.</p>
                                                          <p>For some taxa there is a stronger case for prehistoric domesticatory relationships. Maypops (<i>Passiflora incarnata</i> L.) has been considered a quasi-cultigen because of its close association with humans in eastern North America prehistorically (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Yarnell, Richard A." data-ref-text="1987  Prehistoric Plant Foods and Husbandry in Eastern North America. &lt;i&gt;Missouri Archaeologist&lt;/i&gt; (in press)." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Yarnell 1987</u></a>). Even tree fruits such as persimmon have had similar long-standing relationships with human groups. It is possible that some management of fruit trees such as persimmon was practiced prehistorically and helped facilitate the adoption of peach as a tree crop.

However, no direct evidence for management of fruit trees has been found. An expected morphological criterion for domestication of edible fruits is increased fruit size, a change that cannot be studied at most open sites using archaeological evidence since fleshy fruit parts are ususally destroyed when burned. Management of some kind does seem likely given the long-standing relationship between populations of humans and persimmon trees in the East, but may have been somewhat casual by European criteria.</p>

Persimmon has from three to eight seeds per fruit and grape one to four, whereas maypops has many. Although "minimum number of individuals" or some similar measure has not been calculated for seed and fruit types, number of seeds per fruit is a factor that should be considered.

Aboriginally some bedstraw species have ethnographically documented medicinal uses among some North American groups (Moerman 1986). It is not known how bedstraw was used at Fredricks, but it was found in relatively large quantities there (5.6% of total identified seeds, ubiquity 28.8% of features). Use of the vegetative parts of the plant as bedding would explain the presence of large numbers of seeds of this genus, which usually grows in wooded rather than open habitats.</p>

Maize was the most important crop, and common bean and pepo squash also were grown. Hickory and acorn seem to have been staples, although their contribution to the diet relative to that of maize has not been assessed. Since there was presumably a long tradition of human use of nut-producing trees in the Piedmont as elsewhere in the East, nut trees were possibly managed in some way, if only indirectly through protection and culling of competing species. In addition to the tropical Mesoamerican cultigens, the Fredricks site people had close relationships with various herbaceous and woody fruit-producing taxa growing in anthropogenic habitats. Management of such species probably spanned a continuum from toleration and unintentional habitat enrichment to protection and perhaps propogation as well. The only Old World domesticates grown at Fredricks, peach and watermelon, were both fleshy fruit crops.</p>
                                                          <p>Excavations to date have revealed no evidence of cultivation or consumption of indigenous starchy or oily grains such as sumpweed, maygrass, chenopod, or knotweed. The only occurrences of such grains at Fredricks are in such small quantities that there is no compelling reason to assume that they are anything other than weed seeds. In many parts of the East, grains like chenopod and maygrass declined from a utilization peak during Woodland times as maize became more important (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Yarnell, Richard A., and M.

However, except for sumpweed, these grain crops (possibly only quasi-cultigens) continued to be used in Historic times in the East, at least at Cherokee sites in the Little Tennessee River valley (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Chapman, Jefferson, and Andrea B. Shea" data-ref-text="1981  The Archaeobotanical Record: Early Archaic Period to Contact in the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley.  &lt;i&gt;Tennessee Anthropologist&lt;/i&gt; 6:61-84." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Chapman and Shea 1981</u></a>).</p>
                                                          <p>Although indigenous grains are poorly represented at Fredricks, maygrass was found in large quantities at the Mitchum site on the Haw River, an Historic period site occupied slightly earlier than Fredricks (<a class="a-ref" data-author="Gremillion, Kristen J." data-ref-text="1987  Plant Remains from the Fredricks, Wall, and Mitchum Sites.  In &lt;i&gt;The Siouan Project: Seasons I and II&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Roy S. Dickens Jr., H. Trawick Ward, and R. P. Stephen Davis, Jr., pp. 185-215.  Monograph Series No. 1. Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill." data-target="#genModal" data-toggle="modal" href="#genModal" target="_top"><u>Gremillion 1987</u></a>). Paleoethnobotanical data from prehistoric sites in the Piedmont will be needed to determine whether cultivation of these indegenous grain-producers was ever a Piedmont tradition as it was elsewhere in the Eastern Woodlands. Perhaps the Mitchum site maygrass represents the persistence of such a tradition into historic times. The Fredricks site people, if they ever had similar traditions (an important question since ethnic relationships between groups occupying sites like Mitchum and Fredricks are unclear), either abandoned them for reasons as yet unknown or carried them out in localities away from the village on the Eno represented by the Fredricks site. In any case, only further excavation can help answer these important questions about Historic period aboriginal subsistence.</p>
