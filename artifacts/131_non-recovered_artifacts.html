          <h1>Non-recovered Artifacts</h1>
                                  <p>During the 1986 excavation, two burials were discovered. In accordance with property owner's wishes, the two burials were carefully excavated, cleaned, and documented, but not removed from the ground. Consequently, the historic trade items that were observed in association with these two burials are not listed in the artifact catalog for the site, nor do they appear in <a href="../tables/table6_1.html" target="_top"><u>Table 7</u></a> or <a href="../tables/table7_1.html" target="_top"><u>Table 8</u></a>.</p>
                                                          <p><a href="../excavations/exc_bw.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 12 (Feature 50)</u></a> was located near the palisade line at the southern end of the site. Excavation revealed a shaft-and-chamber pit containing the remains of a small child or infant. Nine glass trade beads were recovered from pitfill. Associated artifacts included 12 brass bells, one lead bale seal, and possible fabric remnants. Cane matting and shell beads also were associated with this burial. The bells were found in the leg or knee area of the child, similar to <a href="../excavations/exc_bv.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 7</u></a> and <a href="../excavations/exc_aw.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 10</u></a> within the cemetery. The bells, made of sheet brass, were of a flush-edged type with a flush loop and iron pebble. The lead bale seal was stamped with an unintelligible mark. Three other bale seals have been recovered from the plowzone.</p>
                                                          <p><a href="../excavations/exc_ca.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 14 (Feature 54)</u></a> also was located in the southwestern area of the site near a palisade entrance. This burial also was identified as a shaft-and-chamber burial type and contained the remains of a subadult approximately 12 years old. One piece of lead shot, one mirror fragment, two bone-handled knife fragments, and 436 glass beads were recovered from pitfill and from cleaning around the skeletal remains. Of the glass beads, 96% were white, a color pattern exhibited in all other burials found at the site. Historic artifacts occurring as burial associations consisted of nine pewter buttons, one brass buckle frame, 21 brass rings, and several hundred white glass beads. The pewter buttons, similar to South's Type 31 (<a href="../part6/ref_ev.html" target="_top"><u>Noël Hume 1969</u></a>:91), were cast with eyelet and disc molded as a single piece. Similar buttons were recovered from <a href="../excavations/exc_aa.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 1</u></a>. The buttons and the buckle were found in the waist and hip areas of the burial. Of particular interest were the several brass rings that adorned this child. Nine rings were observed on each hand (i.e., three rings on three fingers). Three additional rings were found near the right arm. Only one other brass ring was found elsewhere at the site. Noël Hume (<a href="../part6/ref_ev.html" target="_top"><u>1969</u></a>:265) describes this style of ring as "the most common type, a simple band, convex on the outside and flat inside, which occurs on eighteenth-century sites but which is itself undatable." Numerous white glass beads (Kidd's type IIa) were observed near the right hip and may represent the remains of a beaded garment or sash.</p>
                                                          <p>Unlike other burials at the site, neither of these burials appeared to contain "burial bundles" or clusters of artifacts. This may suggest cultural or status differences for these two individuals. In addition, these burials also contained fewer and less variety of grave goods than most of the previously excavated burials within the cemetery. The higher incidence of ornamental objects, however, is similar to other subadult burials at the site (see <a href="../part6/ref_fs.html" target="_top"><u>Ward 1987</u></a>).</p>
