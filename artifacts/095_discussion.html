          <h1>Discussion</h1>
                                  <p>One primary goal of the pottery analysis was to create a vessel assemblage model for the Fredricks site. This was accomplished by a careful examination of attribute similarities and differences among ceramic types, sherd and vessel frequency distributions, the physical condition of ceramic remains, contextual associations, and general spatial distributions. Consideration of these dimensions of variability permitted the recognition of three ceramic groups: (1) the dominant constituents of the ceramic assemblage, thought to reflect the pottery-making tradition of the Occaneechi; (2) other roughly contemporary pottery that was significantly divergent in form and technology, and most likely produced by non-Occaneechi potters (possibly associated with the nearby Jenrette village); and (3) the ceramic remains of an earlier Late Woodland settlement within the general site vicinity. These groups are briefly summarized below.</p>
                                                          <p>The primary constituents of the Occaneechi ceramic assemblage have been formally designated Fredricks Plain and Fredricks Check Stamped. These two ceramic types comprise over 70% of identifiable sherds (excluding Uwharrie Net Impressed) from features associated with all structures within the village, as well as from burial pit fill within the cemetery (see <a href="../tables/table4_0.html" target="_top"><u>Table 5</u></a>). In addition, these two types are represented by 28 of the 35 whole vessels and vessel sections that were recovered at the site. Aside from minor differences in decoration and vessel morphology, Fredricks Plain and Fredricks Check Stamped are technologically identical to one another; however, there is reasonably good evidence in terms of interior vessel condition to suggest that these two types were functionally distinct. As stated earlier, check-stamped jars (both large and small) appear to have been used primarily as cooking vessels while plain vessels probably functioned more as storage containers.</p>
                                                          <p>With the exception of Uwharrie Net Impressed, the other pottery recovered at the Fredricks site also can be attributed largely to an historic occupational context. Simple Stamped, Cord Marked, and Complicated Stamped ceramics are probably associated entirely with this later occupation while at least some Brushed and Cob Impressed sherds also are associated with the site's Late Woodland component. These potsherds, because of their divergence from Fredricks Plain and Fredricks Check Stamped with respect to decoration, technology, and vessel morphology, are argued to be the products of non-Occaneechi potters. Though some of these artifacts may represent trade vessels, an explanation involving ethnic diversity at the site (or site vicinity) is most plausible, particularly since at least two large storage jars are represented and inter-marriage among different Siouan groups appears to have been common during this period (see <a href="../part6/ref_ad.html" target="_top"><u>Lefler 1967</u></a>). Spatially, this pottery occurred in greatest numbers within pits associated with Structures <a href="../excavations/exc_is.html" target="_top"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="../excavations/exc_ja.html" target="_top"><u>5</u></a>, and <a href="../excavations/exc_je.html" target="_top"><u>9</u></a>, all located on the northeast side of the village (see <a href="../tables/table4_1.html" target="_top"><u>Table 5</u></a>). To what degree this distribution may reflect residence patterns is unknown.</p>
                                                          <p>Finally, all Uwharrie Net Impressed pottery and at least some other pottery can be attributed to a Late Woodland occupation at the site. This occupation is represented by Feature 30, which contained (excluding indeterminate sherds) 87.7% Uwharrie Net Impressed, 6.2% brushed, 4.9% plain, and 1.2% cob-impressed pottery. Although Uwharrie Net Impressed pottery also was present in other features, particularly those in the northeastern half of the site, most of these sherds were heavily eroded and did not represent any reconstructable vessel sections. In fact, both Uwharrie Net Impressed vessels identified at the site were simply large rimsherds that were recovered from <a href="../excavations/exc_ba.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 30</u></a> and <a href="../excavations/exc_ck.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 8</u></a> (interpreted as a tree disturbance).</p>
